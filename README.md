A client library for a memcached cluster.

It supports the binary memcached protocol and SASL authentication. No support
for the ASCII protocol is provided. It supports connecting to a single, or a
cluster of memcached servers. When connecting to a cluser, consistent hashing
is used for routing requests to the appropriate server.

Complete coverage of the memcached protocol is provided except for multi-get
and other pipelined operations.

## Licensing

This library is BSD-licensed.

## Tools

This library also includes a few tools for manipulating and experimenting with
memcached servers.

- `OpGen` -- A load generator for memcached. Doesn't collect timing statistics,
  other tools like [mutilate](https://github.com/leverich/mutilate) already do
  that very well. This tool is useful in conjunction with mutilate.
- `Loader` -- A tool to load random data of a certain size into a memcached
  server. Useful for priming a server for testing.

## Architecture Notes

We're relying on `Data.Pool` for thread safety right now, which is fine but is
a blocking API in that when we grab a socket (`withResource`) we are blocking
any other requests being sent over that connection until we get a response.
That is, we can't pipeline.

Now, use of multiple connections through the pool abstraction is an easy way to
solve this and perhaps the right approach. But, could also implement own pool
abstraction that allowed pipelining. This wouldn't be a pool abstraction so
much as just round-robbining over multiple connections for performance.

Either way, a pool is fine for now.
