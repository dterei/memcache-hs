A Memcached client. Memcached is an in-memory key-value store typically used as
a distributed and shared cache. Clients connect to a group of Memcached servers
and perform out-of-band caching for things like SQL results, rendered pages, or
third-party APIs.

A client can connect to a single Memcached server or a cluster of them. In the
later case, consistent hashing is used to route requests to the appropriate
server. The /binary/ Memcached protocol is used and /SASL authentication/ is
supported.

Expected return values (like misses) are returned as part of the return type,
while unexpected errors are thrown as exceptions. Exceptions are either of type
'MemcacheError' or an 'IO' exception thrown by the network.

We support the following logic for handling failure in operations:

* __Timeouts__: we timeout any operation that takes too long and consider it
                failed.
* __Retry__: on operation failure (timeout, network error) we close the
             connection and retry the operation, doing this up to a
             configurable maximum.

* __Failover__: when an operation against a server in a cluster fails all
                retries, we mark that server as dead and use the remaining
                servers in the cluster to handle all operations. After a
                configurable period of time has passed, we consider the server
                alive again and try to use it. This can lead to consistency
                issues (stale data), but is usually fine for caching purposes
                and is the common approach in Memcached clients.

Some of this behavior can be configured through the 'Options' data type. We
also have the following concepts exposed by Memcached:

  [@version@] Each value has a 'Version' associated with it. This is simply a
              numeric, monotonically increasing value. The version field
              allows for a primitive version of 'cas' to be implemented.

  [@expiration@] Each value pair has an 'Expiration' associated with it. Once a
                 a value expires, it will no longer be returned from the cache
                 until a new value for that key is set. Expirations come in two
                 forms, the first form interprets the expiration value as the
                 number of seconds in the future at which the value should be
                 considered expired. For example, an expiration of @3600@
                 expires the value in 1 hour. When the value of the expiration
                 is greater than 30 days however (@2592000@), the expiration
                 field is instead interpreted as a UNIX timestamp (the number
                 of seconds since epoch). The timestamp specifies the date at
                 which the value should expire.

  [@flags@] Each value can have a small amount of fixed metadata associated
            with it beyond the value itself, these are the 'Flags'.

Usage is roughly as follows:

> module Main where
>
> import qualified Database.Memcache.Client as M
>
> main = do
>     -- use default values: connects to localhost:11211
>     mc <- M.newClient [M.def] M.def
>
>     -- store and then retrieve a key-value pair
>     M.set mc "key" "value" 0 0
>     v' <- M.get mc "key"
>     case v' of
>         Nothing        -> putStrLn "Miss!"
>         Just (v, _, _) -> putStrLn $ "Hit: " + show v
